### End to End Learning for Self Driving Cars.
The Idea is to Implement a Research Paper Released By Mariussz Bojarski and The Nvidia Team - "End to End Learning For Self Driving Cars" For Prototyping.
A CNN is trained to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands.

# Why This Paper ?
This paper is a good start for Self Driving Technology Research since it utilizes a simple CNN Architecture to achieve state of the art performance.
The modern Self Driving Car usually utilizes complex Sensors such as Lidars and Radars along side multiple camera system integrations making it very difficult to implement without knowledge in Sensor Fusion and Robotics.
This Network eliminates the need all that hustle with a single camera integration.
