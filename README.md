# EV-Research and Development - #1
This repository is the first in journey of Electric Vehicle Research and Development

The Idea is to Implement a Research Paper Released By Mariussz Bojarski and The Nvidia Team - "End to End Learning For Self Driving Cars"

A CNN is trained to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands.

# Why This Paper ?
This paper is a good start for Self Driving Technology Research since it utilizes a simple CNN Architecture to achieve state of the art performance.
The modern Self Driving Car usually utilizes complex Sensor such as Lidar and Radars along side multiple camera system integrations making it very
difficult to implement without strong foundation in Robotics and Sensor Fusion.
This Network eliminates the need all that hustle with a single camera integration.
